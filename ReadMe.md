<h1>Finding Pi value by Counting</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Basically Pi is known as a float number which is irrational.
Most of the natural phenomena is containing calculation with Pi. This number is not just a thing in maths but also it's combined with our real worlds function like Golden Ratio.

<h2>Ideology</h2>

We all know that Pi is the constant we used for defining circular thing like area of circle, circumstance of a circle, volume of a sphere, surface area of a sphere, volume of cylinder, surface are of cylinder ant etc.

So, If we want to find the value of Pi by a manual method like counting we have to integrate of those geometry function with a manual tool like counting. For that purpose I select the tool Probability function.

<h2> How t use Probability here. </h2>

We can define probability of an event as,
$$\text{Probability of an event}=\frac{\text{count an event happen}}{\text{count of total possible event}}$$ 

so lets take a quarter circle with radius R which is placed inside of a square with length of a side is R.
